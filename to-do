// --------------Thoughts-------------- //
We could just start working on Qt app, the basics of an desktop
app like bars, menus and controls.
Or could work on nanopb, and how to read from a stream.
Or add tests for the source files.
Or virtual serial port for testing.

Need to add tests. Procastinating on it a lot. Not a good thing.
Got stream to working, but yet to figure out how to recover from lost 'bytes'.
May have to introduce delimeter or something.
Should start working on Qt app. 
Need to fine tune nvim as well. 
Name! what name should I give. Consult sanskrit expert for it. May be. I don't know.
Need to do some digging. It would be just better if we set the deadline to migrate 
to github. 26th Feb Sunday sounds like a nice deadline to have.
